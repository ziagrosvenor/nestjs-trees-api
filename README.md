# Tree Querying API

This API is built with Nest JS. It was bootstrapped using the Nest JS CLI.

There is a single endpoint which has a range of optional query params.


The API supports the following queries.

* Querying all tree items with totalTrees
[http://localhost:3000/trees](http://localhost:3000/trees)

* Querying within a date range
[http://localhost:3000/trees?startDate=2020-02-17T16:31:33.369Z&endDate=2020-06-19T09:05:39.511Z](http://localhost:3000/trees?startDate=2020-02-17T16:31:33.369Z&endDate=2020-06-19T09:05:39.511Z)

* Querying all normal trees
[http://localhost:3000/trees?varient=normal](http://localhost:3000/trees?varient=normal)

* Option to add total trees grouped by projectId to the response
[http://localhost:3000/trees?totalTreesGroupedBy=projectId](http://localhost:3000/trees?totalTreesGroupedBy=projectId)


Other queries

* Querying before an endDate
[http://localhost:3000/trees?endDate=2020-06-19T09:05:39.511Z](http://localhost:3000/trees?endDate=2020-06-19T09:05:39.511Z)

* Querying all referral trees
[http://localhost:3000/trees?varient=referral](http://localhost:3000/trees?varient=referral)

* Option to add total trees filter by startDate and grouped by varient to the response
[http://localhost:3000/trees?totalTreesGroupedBy=varient&startDate=2020-06-01T09:05:39.511Z](http://localhost:3000/trees?totalTreesGroupedBy=varient&startDate=2020-06-01T09:05:39.511Z)

## Test suites

There are happy path unit tests for the tree controller. If I had more time in the tech test, then I would have added more unit tests to cover edge cases, such as returning an empty result set. I would have also explored using Faker JS to generate test data.

The unit test can be found in `nestjs-trees-app/src/trees/tree.controller.spec.ts`.

I also wrote a few end to end tests, including an test to check that the query param validation for `varient` will respond with a 400 status code on invalid input. 

If I had more time, I would have tested the HTTP status codes returned by the API in error scenarios.

The end to end tests can be found in `nestjs-trees-app/tests/app.e2e-spec.ts`.

```

## HTTP Exception Filter

I read up on HTTP Exception Filters in the NestJS documentation, So I thought it would be worth implementing one to customise the HTTP error responses.

The HTTP Exception Filter class in this repo adds additional metadata to the error response such as `timestamp`.

The class also adds support for logging of error info using NestJS `Logger`.

If I had more time I would have explored using NestJS `Logger` further.

## Installation

```bash
$ yarn
```

## Running the app

```bash
# development
$ yarn start

# watch mode
$ yarn start:dev

# production mode
$ yarn start:prod
```

## Test

```bash
# unit tests
$ yarn test

# e2e tests
$ yarn test:e2e

# test coverage
$ yarn test:cov
```


## TODO list

* Use a database to access the data instead of the fixed JSON file data.

* Some data formatting functions for the response in the tree controller. This should be moved to a data formatting module or moved down to the trees service.

* Remove use of `any` type in `getTotalTreesGroupedByKey` function

* Add unit tests for edge cases such as empty results

* Add integration tests for each query use case.

* Add more integration tests for request validation errors.

* Mock out the NestJS Logger in the integration tests. Add assertions that the Logger is called correctly.

* Add a docker-compose file to make the project easier to run.

* Update Node version in .nvmrc to LTS version.

* Support filtering by `productId`

* Support finding an individual tree planting entity. i.e `GET /trees/:id`
